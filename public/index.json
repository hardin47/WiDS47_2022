[{"categories":null,"contents":"There are a few frontmatter variables that can be used for all fragments. The variables are as follows:\nfragment type: string\nRequired for every fragment\nweight type: number\nRequired for every fragment\nThis variable is used for ordering fragments in a page. It can be empty but it would cause the fragment to be sorted in an unexpected manner.\nbackground Set the background of the fragment.\nBackground also affects the text color of the fragment\u0026rsquo;s content. For the background colors of white, light, secondary and primary we use Bootstrap\u0026rsquo;s text_dark class on content and for other backgrounds, we use text_light.\ntitle type: string\nSet title of the fragment\nsubtitle type: string\nSet subtitle of the fragment\ntitle_align type: string\naccepted values: right, left, center\nChange alignment of fragment\u0026rsquo;s header\npadding type: string\nExperimental\nChanges the padding of fragment\u0026rsquo;s container\nasset type: asset object\nThis variable is not a global variable but a variable type that is used in a lot of fragments.\nAny fragment that uses this variable type would show either an image or an icon.\nThe type is introduced to make configuring images and icons same between different fragments.\nSome fragments automatically resize images to better fit the layout. For the best result use the documented size of each fragment\u0026rsquo;s asset object. To disable image resizing use assets stored within static/ as these are excluded from auto resizing. Please make sure to provide the correct size as documented for each fragment\u0026rsquo;s asset object.\nasset.image type: string\nasset.icon type: string\nIcon class powered by FontAwesome such as fab fab-github.\nasset.url type: string\nAction/clickable URL of the image or the icon.\nasset.text type: string\nIf asset.image is set, text will be used as alternative text (alt-text) of the image.\ndisable type: boolean\nIf set to true, Syna will not register the fragment. This is useful for drafting fragments.\nNOTE: disable doesn\u0026rsquo;t register the fragment at all. This means you can not remove a global fragment in a specific page by a duplicate disabled fragment. In order to hide a global fragment in a page, use hide.\nhide type: boolean\n","permalink":"/program/program/","tags":null,"title":"Program"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"/search/","tags":null,"title":"Search"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"/post/2020-12-01-r-rmarkdown/","tags":null,"title":"Hello R Markdown"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"/post/","tags":null,"title":"Posts"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"/","tags":null,"title":"WiDS Claremont"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"/about/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"/registration/_index/","tags":null,"title":"Registration"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"/registration/","tags":null,"title":"Registrations"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"/speakers/","tags":null,"title":"WiDS Claremont Speakers"},{"categories":null,"contents":"WiDS Claremont is an independent event organized by Manisha Goel, Jo Hardin, and Michelle Zemel to coincide with the annual Global Women in Data Science (WiDS) Conference held at Stanford University and an estimated 150+ locations worldwide.
