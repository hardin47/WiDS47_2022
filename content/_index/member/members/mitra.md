Mitra Akhtari

graduated from [Harvard with an Economics PhD](https://economics.harvard.edu/phd-program) in May 2017. She is currently a data scientist at [Airbnb](https://airbnb.io/), supporting the policy team.  As an economist by training, her main area of expertise is applied micro-economics and causal inference. She combines quasi-experimental methods and observational data to estimate underlying causal relationships. In addition, she loves using data to tell stories: sometimes the most compelling points are made by simple and creative descriptive statistics and not fancy models. One example is a fantastic data project which was used in several federal court cases in 2017,The [Immigrant Doctors Project](https://immigrantdoctors.org/).
